 How to create a pseudo web app for the Node Red dashboard using the Brave browser.
 
 Some browsers, such as Brave, allow you to launch a site without all of the standard browser accoutrement. This is ideal for a Node Red dashboard when you don't want all the tab bars, menu bars, status bars, and the rest of the folderol that goes with a normal browser window. Technically, this isnâ€™t really a web application, but from a desktop standpoint, it behaves as one.
 
 See the excellent PDF article from TechRepublic that is in this repository for more detailed instructions.
